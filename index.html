    <h1>Interneting Is Easy!</h1>
    <p>First, we need to learn some basic HTML. </p>
    
    <h2>Headings</h2>
    <p>
        Headings define the outline of your site. There are six levels of headings.
    </p>

    <h2>Lists</h2>
    <p>This is how we make an unordered list:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Add a "ul" element (it stands for unordered list)</li>
        <li>Add each item in its own "li" element</li>
        <li>They don't need to be in any particular order</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This is what an ordered list looks like:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Notice the "ol" element wrapping everythins?</li>
        <li>But, the list item elements are the same</li>
        <li>Also note how the numbers increment on their own</li>
        <li>We should be noticing thins is in precise order, because this is an 
            ordered list.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Inline Elements</h2>
    <p>
        <em>Sometimes,</em> we need to draw attention to a particular word or phrase.
    </p>
    <p>
        Other times, we need to <strong>strongly</strong> emphasize the importance of a word or phrase.
    </p>

    <h2>
        <em>And sometimes you need to shout!</em>
    </h2>

    <h2>Empty Elements</h2>
    <p>Thanks for reading! Interneting should be getting easier now.</p>
